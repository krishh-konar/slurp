# üî• Ball Aerospace

Whew! That‚Äôs a big subject! In 2016 Ball Aerospace celebrated it‚Äôs 60th year of
aerospace research and equipment production. Today, approximately 65 years since
its founding in 1956, in Boulder, Colorado, Ball Aerospace is huge. In 2014 it
was cited as the 88th largest defense contractor in the world. I worked there
from 1980 to 1986 in Ball‚Äôs primary facility in Boulder, Colorado.

Ball Aerospace is in the space business, building spacecrafts, satellites, and
scientific instruments used for research and defense. Ball also produces
lubricants, optical systems and antennas of many different types.

My relevant background began in 1978 when I was hired as an electronic assembler
by a small custom electronic assembly firm, Technical Manufacturing Services,
which was started by two former employees of Ball Aerospace. Upon hire at Ball
in 1980, I became a Prototype Assembler, working as part of a team that
developed innovative electronic assembly techniques. I also worked in the
Antennas Lab, building and testing the antennas that astronauts wore on their
extra-vehicular backpacks. (Antennas can be very tricky. One day one of the
antennas I was testing was not performing properly. I cussed at it and then it
started working. I‚Äôm not kidding!) During that time I studied electronics and
after a year I received my certification as an electronic technician. Then I
worked in Receiving Inspection at Ball, inspecting, testing and certifying
incoming electronic parts. Then I was promoted to the Metrology Lab, testing,
calibrating, certifying and repairing equipment used in aerospace electronics
labs at Ball, other institutions and in space. I held a Confidential Security
clearance and certifications for assembly, cleaning and static protection of
aerospace flight electronics. I also designed and built some test fixtures and I
wrote test procedures.

So what is the point of me describing all of my great accomplishments while I
was employed at Ball Aerospace? It certainly is not bragging. I was a small
player in a **BIG** game and I would only like to give the readers an idea of
the enormity and the complexity of the business that is Ball Aerospace.

Much of the work we were doing at Ball Aerospace was for NASA (National
Aeronautics and Space Administration) and one of the projects I worked on was
for IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite), a cryogenically cooled space
telescope. The project required that EVERY instrument and tool used had to be
certified as accurate and complying with specifications. One day, one of the
NASA inspectors shut the project down (temporarily) because a FLASHLIGHT had not
been certified. As one might imagine, that caused a few arguments. Err, um, OK,
more than a few arguments.

I also spent just a little time working in a giant anechoic chamber, a huge,
very tall room that had literally every surface covered in sound absorbing
materials for the purpose of working with antennas and any other source/receiver
of energy. Imagine being in an environment that has absolutely no echo
whatsoever. Such an environment simulates the sound behavior characteristics of
space. Some people find that environment quite disturbing and creepy. The
scientists who worked in the antennas department were considered ‚Äúout there‚Äù.

I worked in ‚Äúclean rooms‚Äù from time to time. Because in space, contaminants can
be a real problem, adhering to, and affecting the behavior of electronic and
especially optical devices, we had to be very conscientious in avoiding ANY
contamination of objects that would end up in space. We avoided such
contamination and we spent a great deal of time cleaning, using cleaning agents
that would leave no residue. Whew - talk about being picky!

We could not take anything into a clean room that might be contaminated and that
included ourselves. How would we accomplish that? We would enter a clean room
and then put on clothing that was ‚Äúclean‚Äù and then go from there into another
clean room. The clothing consisted of booties, a sealed ‚Äúbunny suit‚Äù with
gloves, a head covering with a face mask, and if someone with a beard was
dressing for the occasion, they would also wear what we called ‚Äúface panties‚Äù to
keep any beard hairs/particles from escaping. Respirators were in order and
clothing was sealed with elastic and Velcro. To top it all off, we were
grounded, through a sort of network of resistors to avoid any static charge from
damaging sensitive electronic components. The resistor network was so that if
any heavy current was present, we could not be short circuited and electrocuted
easily.

The static protection I just described was pretty much standard practice when
working with most equipment, in or out of clean rooms. You may have the
impression that Ball Aerospace is a business that revolves around and depends
upon technology for its existence. You would be correct, and you would also be
correct in projecting that assumption upon much more of the technology with
which we are surrounded today.
